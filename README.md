CHAOS 2.0
=========

***The next generation of CHAOS!***

A complete rewrite of the CHAOS ExtraCSS Flags script done in [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) for direct use with [BetterPonymotes](http://rainbow.mlas1.us/).

Likely to be extremely incompatible with CHAOS 1.0, backwards compatability is a drag.
