PROJECT CHAOS (2.0)
===================

I don't work on this much any more, but I do plan on picking it back up later. (We can rebuild it! Harder, better, faster, stronger!)

For now it's officially "dropped" and has been switched from a Creative Commons license to Kopyleft, of which it will keep even after i pick it back up, so have fun!

(Apologies for the mess, I'll clean it up some day....) 

#Old Description

***The next generation of CHAOS!***

A complete rewrite of the CHAOS ExtraCSS Flags script done in [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) for direct use with [BetterPonymotes](http://rainbow.mlas1.us/).

This project is compiled using [Compass](http://compass-style.org/), [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/), [Clean-CSS](https://github.com/GoalSmashers/clean-css), and [Enhance-CSS](https://github.com/GoalSmashers/enhance-css).

Likely to be extremely incompatible with CHAOS 1.0, backwards compatibility is a drag.
